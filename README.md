# MySpotify

Congradulations! You've made it to this page. Here's how to download this. 

1. Click on the blue button that says 'code' (it's either green or blue depending on if you're in light/dark mode).

2. Choose "download zip".

3. Perhaps move that zip file out of your Download's folder  to your desktop, or somewhere you won't loose it.

4. Unzip the file. You might have to look this up if your computer doesn't make it easy on you.

5. You should have a folder called "MySpotify" or something.

6. This is very important, you must use Google Chrome. Don't use Firefox or a different browser. I want you to open up Chrome.

7. When you're on chrome, go ahead and press `Ctrl + O` if you're using Windows, or `Cmd + O` for Mac.

8. Navigate to the "MySpotify" folder, and open the file `index.html`. There are like three files named `index` so make sure you open the one that ends with `.html`. (Sorry I'm terrible at naming files).

9. There you go! It should work. If things look like they're broken go ahead and send me a text or call. Oh yeah, please make sure to scroll! There's two different scrollable sections of the webpage. I want to make sure you read it all.

10. Also, life hack, you can click on that timeline thing at the top to quickly navigate to parts of the webpage.
