                            This is one of the oldest songs I keep coming back to. This song has fused itself to many of my core memories. It reminds me of how much I've grown as a person, and gives me the inspiration to keep going. Do note that at this point in my life I didn't really listen to the lyrics. And I still don't (moreso for this song). Instead I focus on the energy of the sound, the way it moves, and the memories it reminds me of.

                            I absolutely love this song. I don't remember when I first heard it, but I know it was a very long time ago. I listened to this song before I moved to Oregon, and before I was in high school. This was the first song I shared with someone else. My older brother laughed at it, he didn't understand that it meant it lot to me. At the time, I didn't know how to laugh with him. I took it personally. I forgive him now, but it took me a while to get over it. I learned (unfortunately) how much it hurts to be vulnerable and rejected.

                            So funny story, I had no idea that this song was mainstream. Ever since I got into music, I always found my songs through the algorithm. I first heard a cover of this song, and embarrassingly I thought it was the original - like for years. Once I found out, I switched to listening to the original. I think it was around this time I really started to learn programming. I might have just finished my JavaScript courses on Khan Academy. I would spend hours by myself in my bedroom learning and making things (I called them simulations). I enjoyed being alone, listening to music, and thinking to myself.

                            This song is very nostalgic to me. When I listen to it now, I just picture young me, programming little games and drinking coffee (I started very young). I remember being amazed at the transitions in theme, and the range of the song. And the constant beat, it kept me focused.

                            Big noise, catchy beat, and a little bit nerdy. This song is a good representation of my music taste at the time. I still listen to this song when I want to remember the feeling of being young.

                            I had just moved up from California, and was told that I'm going to high school in Oregon. It was my birthday month, and I'm sure I was feeling a lot of things.

                            Again, the catchy beat and the big noise. I remember being offended when Spotify said I listened to "stomp and holler". I was embarrassed, I didn't want to be different. I was afraid of not finding connection in high school, and I didn't want my friends to find out what I listened to. Seriously, I remember even in my senior year I would have cold sweats when spotify unwrapped came out. I was afraid of being rejected.

I would spend my time in class scribbling in my notebooks my program ideas. Every opportunity I could I tried to spend on my own projects.

                            This song is incredibly meaningful to me. It was my first love song. It made me feel that I was worth loving and that I had a purpose. I was also finding my religious identity. See, I was raised Catholic, but I never bought into it. This song made me realize that I can enjoy aspects of religion, like the story, without having to fear it.

                            While I was making this website, this song surprised me. I didn't know that I listened to this song so long ago! It goes to show that this song doesn't remind me of anything. It's a good song and I still listen to it.

                            I listened to a lot of Dirt Poor Robins in high school. I would go as far to say that they were my favorite band in high school. I love this song because it allusioned Flowers for Algernon. I didn't know Dirt Poor Robins was cool like that.

                            This song is controversial for me. I like it, but I also don't? It's very situational. When I'm in the flowstate I like this song, but when I'm not it sounds bad? Regardless, this song was a meaningful part of my life. And, this artist comes back much later in my life unexpectedly after my 'divorce'.

                            This song is lame, seriously. I almost always skip it when it comes in queue. But, there's this one good part from 1:00 to 1:45. I like how the music moves with the lyrics. (e.g. "relaxed" makes the song relax, "banging my head against the wall" makes the beat louder). But then I feel like the song loses the plot after 1:45, so that's when I skip it.

                            Waiting for the school bus to come at 6:36 am. The air outside was cold, but the bus was too hot. The air inside was wet, the windows fogged, and the seats made of fake leather. They dropped us off at school an hour early. I walked outside to the track and climbed up the bleachers to watch the sunrise. Usually I was alone. I watched the flocks of crows land on the field. I sat their in silence, watching the stillness of it all.

                            I hate competetion in school. Every grade. Sure, it felt good when I did good. But, just as easily I felt useless when I didn't. I wanted to be free from it all. I wanted independence, or maybe just to run away.

                            This artist's inspiration comes from morbid curiosity. His character's perspectives are corrupt. But in all his songs, there's an thick infectious air of confidence.

                            The movement of this song felt isolating. It was how I felt at the time. I felt isolated from my family. And, I felt isolated from school. I spent more time alone. I started seeing things that weren't real. I had hallucinations. Shadows regularily jumped scared me. Though, within it all, I felt a connection to myself. I found love within myself and within my own projects. This song reminds me of my past self, and I wish I could go back in time to be my own older brother.

                            I had to make a presentation for this album in my English class. I loved the project, I listened to this album so many times. It was all I listened to for about a month. I spent hours working on my presentation. I kept delaying when I had to present just to have more time to add finishing touches. I remembered my classmates enjoyed my presentation, but I'm pretty sure I got a B- or a C+. I poured my heart and soul into it for literally weeks. Anyways, that's why I don't like English classes. At least the experience got me into Kendrick Lamar.

                            This is another controversial song. I usually skip it when it's in queue. But, if I'm in the flowstate, the steady beat and slow buildup of the song helps my focus. Around this time, I think I was also experimenting with more artists. I would go into my favorite artists and see which songs inspired them, or which artists people also listen to.

                            A beautiful song. Later in college, I got into mnemonics and imagination, and I crafted a story for this song. Now it's one of my most vivid stories. When I go through the story in my head, it's like I'm actually there. Almost like I'm in a lucid dream.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                            There's a pillar of earth, miles high, within in an endless sea. Our view climbs the cliff until we reach the top. The pillar is only a couple feet in diameter. There's a man, he's immortal. He's standing on top of the pillar. Medium length grass flows beneath his feet. He stands in silence watching the horizon. The days pass by. He jumps. He falls. He points his hands in front of his head and dives. He plunges into the sea. The Gods, angry at his defiance, cause the sea to swallow him whole. But, in his sacrifice, the seas recedes. Nature overflows on the empty seabed.

                            Another sexy song. I love to listen to this song alone in my room at night, when the walls are spinning and the colors are mixing. I dance with the invisible ghost, either a version of myself or someone I admire.

                            I listen to this song a lot during my senior of high school, then some more during my freshman year at UO. I highly recommend watching the music <a href="https://youtu.be/OcmBowQsVrg?si=zRNAdHqCiCPP3qUE" target="_blank">video</a> if you want to experience something weird.

                            This song puts me at peace. Everytime I listen to it, I think of the same scene. A creaky white house in a clearing of a forest. A young man on the porch walks out to his friends on the grass. A roaring bonfire, the sparks fly into the dusk sky and become the stars. They dance around the fire without care. Lay on the grass, watch the stars, feel the warmth, and breath the air.

                            They walk in thousands across an old highway bridge. The bridge stretches for miles, it hovers over the green hills. Shoulder to shoulder, the poor faces march forwards. The sky opens, she cries. She moves against the crowd, bringing color. It's never enough.

                            I absolutely love this song. Though, I will warn you that it's like the black coffee of music. It's full, but it's also rough around the edges. An acquired taste. I used to think this song was about the Vietnam War, but recently (2025) I read the lyrics and I realized it was not.

                            Sometimes, a lot times actually, I will listen to a song on repeat before I add it to my liked songs. I remember listening to this song in high school, but here we are. This song reminds me of a lot of things. It reminds me of love, but also being hurt by that love. This artist also gave me my expectations for college life.

                            My favorite part is when he says "I'm falling over my own steps, they get so clumsy when you get to me", and the guitars ritardando. The music fades, the guitars have their solos. Then the music crescendos into a trill, and the energy pushes to the end.

                            I think you'd like this song. Or, at least I bet you'd like the album cover. I know you like bugs and creatures. I like this song because I like how the artist "stretches" their voice. I don't think I've heard anything else like it.

                                This song starts unassumingly with a peaceful vibe similar to <a href="#the_archer_am">"The Archer"</a> by Adam Melchor. Though, it's almost like the artist has bottled up their feelings, and he is slowly loosing control. The first time I heard this song, the ending caught me off guard. I wasn't expecting to hear so much pain. Loosing all control, and being consumed by the feeling of something lost.

                            I think it's fun to lip sync to some songs, and this is one of those songs for me. I enjoy the flow of her voice, and the tambourine.

                           This song makes me think of proletarians dancing in a waltz in a dark room. They're under the roads. A man singing in the center of the room. "Up there, they're drinking down the day", the bourgeoisie are swirling their wine glasses in their bright houses. While the proletariat sway to the movement of the music.

                            I used to think this cover was the original. I really enjoy what the artist had done here. It makes me think of some (weird) imagery, and I'll try my best to explain. 
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            We start in a grey desert. "Don't fall into my arms", the sky turns pink from the sunrise. The air crisp, the landscape barren. "I don't have anything on my mind, I don't want to talk to you". The sky turns from pink to yellow. The grey desert gains color. "Do you want to talk?" Ancient trees sprout from the sand. A river forms around the dune we're standing on, turning it into an island. A family of giant creatures with grey skin walk on their palms. "I don't have anything on my mind", the sky erupts with color, the landscape full of life, the desert a mix of greys, reds, and yellows.

                            So something must've happened here, because I used to listen to this song a lot in my senior year of high school. But looking at the timeline above, it looks like we're about half way through college. Anyways, I also listened to this song a lot in college. So, it all works out. It's been one of my feel good songs. This song does make me think of some imagery, but it's not that strong. So, I don't really feel the need to explain it. Regardless, this song has been with me for a very long time.

                            Ah haha, I've been waiting for this one. The significance of this song is huge. This is the first song where I've attempted to use music as a mnemonic device. This song is where I started it all. And, by that I mean, this is the moment in time where I started to really think about what music does to my senses. I practiced recalling the same images to the same sounds. I fully believed that imagination was something that can be improved. With enough practice, I thought I can transcend my mind into a story of my creation.
                            <br><br>
                            The imagery of this song is pretty funny now. I tried to use it to memorize every name in Barnhart. Though, I've never got the technique down. However, the song does make me think about walking the rounds through the building. The only catch is, instead of going from 7th to ground, I walk from ground to 7th.
                            <br><br>
                            Also, to give you an image of how much practice I've put into my hobby here, I would listen to music with the sole intention of practicing recall for about 2-4 hrs a day, every day, for about two years. I remember my good friend asked me what I do with my free time. And my answer was, "I listen to music". I would try to then best explain the mneumonic element of music, which is when I usually loose him. This is a huge part of my identity, though I'm not sure how many people know that about me.

                            God, I love this song. I have the most vivid imagery while listening to it. I want to give you peak behind the curtains. It's not really translatable, but this should be good hint of how my mneumnonic works.
                            <br><br>
                            0:05-0:10 We're walking down a stairway. The one you might find in a parking garage.
                            <br><br>
                            0:10-0:25 We look outside, the sight is apocalyptic. Concrete skyscrapers, now crumbling. There's little to any green. A single tree grows from the center of the road.
                            <br><br>
                            0:25-0:50 We're just looking down the different streets.
                            <br><br>
                            0:50-1:15 We're flying! The crumpling city shrinks as we reach the clouds.
                            <br><br>
                            1:15-1:40 We plunge to the earth, and find ourselves in the forest. We run through the branches, having to duck and twist around to not get caught.
                            <br><br>
                            1:40-2:05 We're flying again! We reach the clouds.
                            <br><br>
                            2:05-2:40 We land back in the city. We go into an abandoned shop. There's nothing there, except for an empty glass display. I guess it's cool to be inside.
                            <br><br>
                            2:40-3:00 Once again, we're flying! Better get used to it.
                            <br><br>
                            3:00-3:08 We land on the earth. The ground crumbles and swallows us whole.
                            <br><br>
                            3:08-3:34 We're in a cave. The sound bouncing off the cave walls. We climb over boulders. Where are we going? I would argue it doesn't matter. This whole story is nonsense, that's half the fun.
                            <br><br>
                            3:35-end That's about it! This is when I usually let my focus go and enjoy the rest of the song.

                            I remembered when this movie came out, and I always wanted to see it. It took me years, but when I finally watched it, I loved it. The soundtrack is so clever, because the only tool Paul Dano has is Daniel Radcliffe, and the music emphasizes that.

                            I really enjoy the emotions in this song. It does hit a little close to home, but that arguably makes it better. By far, my favorite part is the explosive of sound after she says, "I'll be the one to deliver the news".

                            Cmon, I have to include one classical song on this list because I'm a band nerd. This song is not just any classical song, though, it's special. The main (basically only) way my brothers and I spend time together is through games. And, one game we played a lot of was Civ 5. This was in the soundtrack you'd hear when you played Poland. And everytime it played, I would just lock the fuck in.

                            My parents are both Texan, and a lot of my extended family still lives in Texas. I never got to really connect with them growing up. I was too far away. Though, during my senior year at UO (2024) I visited my grandparents. This song reminds me of them. They treated me like family even though it was like the first time we'd ever met. It was sad to go, they wanted us to stay for longer.

                            I programed my "Housing webscraper" to this song. The program collected all of our resident's emails and formated it in a spreadsheet. I find it kind of hilarious that this is my soundtrack for collecing personal information. If I work for Facebook, you know I'll be playing this song while I collect every statistic of your online presence.

                            Then it happened. I couldn't believe it. The person I loved for more than four years broke up with me over text. I never felt more empty. I felt like my purpose vanished. I would listen to this song and cry. Her birthday is in August, mine is in July.

                            She broke up with me over text, suddenly. She refused to talk to me. She told me to get over it, to let her go. I did let her go, but I was left alone. I was struck. Was this the same person I had dedicated my life to? All of my care, sacrifices, and love. And, for what? Do I not deserve anything more than a text?

                            This is the point where I realized I reached rock bottom. I had stopped taking care of myself. I can barely remember it now. I had spent so much of my life taking care of her. Now I have all the time to take care of me. I started to reach out to friends. I spent a lot of time with Kai and Thomas. I was slowly rearranging the shatter pieces of my life back together.

                            Around this time, I remember asking you if you wanted to go to the bar. When you said yes, it gave me the confidence to ask the rest of our team. That night was the turning point of my life.

                            It's Spring break. I started to discover who I was. I was becoming happy. For most of my life, I had faced dread. But now, I was at peace. I went on many walks, ate healthy food, took care of my plant, and I would text you. You were on your road trip to Idaho. I missed seeing you, so I decided to text you. You made me feel wanted. For just being broken up with, that was a feeling that I was struggling with. And so, I'm very thankful for our conversations.

                            I remember when I got my haircut, and I started to grow out my beard and I was exercising. I started to love myself. I pictured myself as a human, and a creature. I think I managed to humanize myself in a way I've never felt before. I started to think about how ancient my DNA is. There is so much life in me, and all of it works in harmony. And each organ works on its own, outside of "my" control. This made me feel like I wasn't alone, because I share myself with myself.

                            You know, writing all these reflections has made me learn a lot about myself (shocker). I know that this song has tell-tale signs pointing to that I was very focused during this time. Knowing this now has been a great relief. I used to have this intrusive thought that I was slacking off (lazy, stoner, etc). Though now I know that I was actually working really hard on trying to feel better.

                            Honestly, it all happened much faster than I gave myself credit for. Once things got calmer, I started to see where I was (in life) more clearly. I think of it this way, imagine you swim off the shore. Let's say you're not paying attention to the shore, and some time has passed. At some point, you'll find out that you've drifted. And for me, I got caught in a ripcurrent. When I got out, I've realized just how far away I was from where I'd started. This song reminds me of how I felt calm but also distant.

                            This song makes me picture walking through the carnage of a battlefield after the war has ended. I think my imagination was trying to tell me that I was relieved, but also still processing.

                           I think these songs are out of order (slightly). Or, at least to say that these songs don't necessarily represent a coherent timeline. With that said, I remember I had a lot of desire to improve myself to show to myself that I would survive.

                          This song and the previous give me a very similar vibe. This song is like the feeling of victory. The type of feeling like you've outmatched your opponent. But it also reminds me of the feeling of finishing something great.

                            This is going to sound like a joke, but bare with me. This song is not a song that I go to, but it's a song that comes to me. As in, the song doesn't make me feel a certain way, but I have to feel a certain way to hear this song. Anyways, the much shorter response is, I listen to this song when I'm happy.

                            This song has been coming up in my recent life after I've done that was scary and emotionally difficult, but also critically important for me to do to move on.

                            This song makes me feel two almost incompatible feelings, 1.) the feeling that I need to cherish every moment left in this term, 2.) that I'm ready to move on.

                            I memorized this whole song because I wanted to see if I could. I used to listen to this song a lot some years ago (I've forgotten). But, I really enjoy it now. It reminds me some of your music taste. I'm really curious to what you think.

                            This is the song that inspired all of this. I know this is sappy, but it's hard to think of a time where I'd felt more listened to than the time you gave me your notes on Slaughter Beach, Dog.

                            Here were are, at the end of the list. It took me a lot longer to write my thoughts down than I originally gave myself time for. Since then, a lot has happened. For instance, the strike happend. Oh yeah, and I got a kidney stone. So I'd like to dedicate this song to picketing, and the passing of my kidney stone. Consider this song as an encore. Time moves on, and with it, I collect more songs.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            And maybe,
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            you have too.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            (and post-strike Joseph talking): I've come back to edit some of my thoughts on the later songs because I realized I rushed them. As in, my opinions changed the more I thought about them. I now know for next time I should wait a few days to allow my ideas to marinate before delivering the final product. Don't go looking for those old notes! I mean you can, you have free will and it's possible to go "back-in-time" on GitHub. Though, know that those were my old thoughts.

                        <p>You've given me something that's difficult for me to even express.</p>
                        <p>You've given me friendship.</p>
                        <p>It's hard to say goodbye. The time passed by so quick.</p>
                        <p>And soon it will come to an end.</p>
                        <p>I'm happy for you. I feel honored to have known you. You have touched my soul.</p>
                        <p>You've given me a gift when you shared with me your favorite songs.</p>
                        <p>Something to remember you by, an immortal feeling that I can always go back to.</p>
                        <p>And I want to return the favor.</p>

                        <p>You can remember the good times.</p>
                        <p>The cold walk to Riley.</p>
                        <p>The one beer too many.</p>
                        <p>The time(s) you've beat me in chess.</p>
                        <p>The first round through Riley, and knocking on the bathroom doors.</p>
                        <p>The time when we were the young RAs, and then when we were the old RAs.</p>
                        <p>The time we spent in the union, fighting for what we believed was right.</p>
                        <p>The time in the river, and telling the birds and the nutria that they're beautiful.</p>
                        <p>And now, its time on to move on.</p>
                        <p>Like we always do. From one thing to the next.</p>
                        <p>I'm not sure what the future will look like. But I'm happy for us.</p>
                        <p>Because something you helped me discover, is that when the world has fallen apart.</p>
                        <p>Go to your friends.</p>
                        <p>And I'll always be your friend.</p>
                        <p>If you need anything, I'm here.</p>
                        <p>Thank you, for everything.</p>
                        <p>I'm going to miss you.</p>
